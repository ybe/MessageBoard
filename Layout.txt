Creating layouts

Please note that this guide is just a short reference. Most entries 
are used in the default layout. Refer to the file "Default.lua" to see
actual usage. Please do not edit the "Default.lua" file, as your layout
then will be overwritten the next time you update MessageBoard.

1. Basics

The layout-functionality of MessageBoard is usable in two ways. It can 
be set directly by writing a new file and include that in the add-on 
loader-list (after Default.lua), or it can be set in memory by another
add-on. The latter being useful by for example UI designers who wants
MessageBoard to fit better with their own UI.
An easy way of doing this is to have your add-on wait until the table 
"MessageBoardXML.Layout" exists. Then you can insert a table in it with 
the name of your layout containing the data. Do not create this in 
your add-on, as MessageBoard will empty it when it loads.

A layout is defined as a LUA table that may contain from a single
element up to all elements available in MessageBoard. It uses standard 
WoW LUA and XML standards. This is the definition of the title text in 
the deafult layout:
	Title={
		Width=451,
		Height=17,
		Anchor1={ Point="TOPLEFT", Relative="TOPLEFT", X=14, Y=-7 },
		FontObject="GameFontHighlight",
		JustifyH="LEFT",
		JustifyV="MIDDLE",
	},
Text-elements also supports colour and font settings.

2. Inherit
A new layout can base its entire layout on another layout. This is 
done by specifying its name in "Inherit". From there, your own layout 
only needs to contain changes from the one you are inheriting from.

For example, if you want to use the default layout but change the title
to center-aligned text, this would be your entire layout-definition:
	MessageBoardXML.Layout["My centered title"]={
		Inherit="Default",			-- Inherits all settings from the layout "Default"
		Main={						-- The main window
			Title={					-- Its title
				JustifyH="CENTER",	-- Horisontal alignment
			},
		},
	}

3. Elements

Elements are divided into types. The available types are main window, 
size, text, lists, and textures.

3.1 Main window
The main window will contain all your elements (see the "Default.lua" 
file). Width, height, and backdrop can be specified. This is the 
definition for the default window:
	Main={
		Width=491,
		Height=491,
		Backdrop={
			File="Interface\\AddOns\\MessageBoard\\Images\\MessageBoardBG",
			Tile=false,
			TileSize=0,
			EdgeFile="",
			EdgeSize=0,
			Insets={ Left=0, Right=-21, Top=0, Bottom=-21 },
		},
	},
The above Backdrop entry follows the WoW LUA frame:SetBackdrop function 
as specified here: http://www.wowwiki.com/API_Frame_SetBackdrop

3.2 Size
A size contains physical size, position and anchors.
	Element={
		Width=100,
		Height=15,
		Anchor1={ Point="TOPLEFT", Relative="TOPLEFT", X=14, Y=-7 },
	},
Several anchors can be set by specifying "Anchor1", "Anchor2", etc.
If you do not want to anchor to the parent frame, you must know the 
name of the frame you want to anchor to, and specify that as "ToFrame" 
in the anchor.

3.3 Text
This element contains normal text, where the look of the text can be 
specified. Like the title-bar and list of topics/authors, etc.
	Element={
		Font={ File="file-name", Size=14, Flags="OUTLINE, THICKOUTLINE ,MONOCHROME" },
		FontObject="GameFontNormal",
		JustifyH="LEFT",
		JustifyV="TOP",
		Color={ r=1, g=1, b=1, a=1 },
	},
"Font" and "FontObject are mutually exclusive, and "Font" will be 
chosen if both are specified.

3.4 List
A list is specifically the list of topics and the list of messages in 
a topic, the left and right lists in the default layout, respectively.
The topics as per default layout:
	TopicScroller={
		Entries=5,
		Width=245,
		Anchor1={ Point="TOPLEFT", X=11, Y=-125 },
		Text={
			FontObject="GameFontNormal",
			JustifyH="LEFT",
			JustifyV="MIDDLE",
		},
	},
A list contains both elements "size" and "text" with the exception of 
the parameter "Height". This has been changed to "Entries" which 
denote how many entries the list will contain, and thus the height 
will be calculated from that.

3.5 Texture
Any number of textures can be added to create a specific graphic layout 
by adding images to the main window. These must be named "Texture1", 
"Texture2", etc.
	Texture1={
		Image="Interface\\AddOns\\MessageBoard\\Images\\MessageBoard_Options",
		Layer="ARTWORK",
		Anchor1={ Point="TOPLEFT", X=0, Y=0 },
		Width=100,
		Height=100,
	},
In addition to image-specific parameters (Image and Layer), a texture 
also supports the "size" element. The "Image" parameter can be any 
image readable by WoW.

NOTE: If you end up with a green square in stead of your image, do the 
following:
1. Check for spelling mistakes.
2. Shut down WoW and restart it. This is often required as WoW needs 
to know about your image-file when it starts. Images added to the 
directory-structure after WoW was started will not be readable.
